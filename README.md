Project P1: Build a Portfolio Site

Replicated a design mockup (from a PDF-file) using HTML and CSS. Used responsive techniques by implementing @media break points as well as incorporating Twitter's Bootstrap CSS. The portfolio is now ready to be expanded through the progression of the Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree.
